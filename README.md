# ChaosMathematik v5.25
This project is purely for fun on here, I don't expect anyone to actually mess
with the code. I found it on some archive CDs recently. It's the first big
programming project I have ever done, written in Delphi 3 and dates back to
August of 1998. Forgive my shoddy coding skills, I was only 14 years at the
time.

Really neat is that there's some screenshots that I did back then and, even
more interesting than the actual program is the whole desktop (e.g., the mIRC
bar). Good times.

All of this was before I used any version control, so naturally on the CD I had
four different versions of everything (including an "alt.zip", i.e.,
"old.zip"), so I'll commit everything (deduplicated) at first and then will try
to sort it properly. The timestamp of the first commit is the oldest timestamp
that is recorded (in "alt.zip").

For some honest-to-god teenage cringe, [look at the original
readme.txt](https://github.com/johndoe31415/chaosmathematik/blob/master/readme.txt) file.
Thankfully only available in German.

Here's some screenshots that I took in 1998:
